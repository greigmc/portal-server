# React-Express-MongoDB Login & Signup Application

## Overview

This project is a **full-stack login and signup application** built with:

- **React** for the frontend
- **Express** for the backend
- **MongoDB** for the database
- **Bootstrap** for styling and layout.
- **Axios** for HTTP client for API requests.
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken** for token-based authentication.

2. Sign in using their credentials.
3. Retrieve a list of all users (admin functionality).

## Recommendations / Future Improvements ðŸš€

- **Protect Private Routes**:  
  Implement authentication middleware to secure backend routes and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Refresh Tokens**:  
  Add refresh token support to allow users to stay logged in without needing to frequently re-authenticate.

- **Forgot Password Functionality**:  
  Allow users to reset their password securely by sending a password reset link to their email.

- **User Roles and Permissions**:  
  Introduce user roles (e.g., Admin, User) to control access to specific parts of the application.

- **Email Verification**:  
  Send verification emails upon signup to confirm the user's email address before allowing full access.

- **Profile Management**:  
  Enable users to update their profile information (name, email, password, etc.) via a settings page.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**:  
  Improve user feedback with toast notifications (e.g., success/error messages) and loading spinners during API calls.

- **Production Deployment**:  
  Prepare the application for deployment by:

  - Creating optimized frontend builds
  - Hosting the backend on services like Render, Railway, or Heroku
  - Hosting the frontend on Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms
  - Using environment variables for secure configurations

- **Testing**:  
  Add unit tests and integration tests for both frontend (React Testing Library) and backend (Jest, Supertest).
